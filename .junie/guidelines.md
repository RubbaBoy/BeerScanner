# Project Guidelines
    
This is a placeholder of the project guidelines for Junie.
Replace this text with any project-level instructions for Junie, e.g.:

* What is the project structure
* Whether Junie should run tests to check the correctness of the proposed solution
* How does Junie run tests (once it requires any non-standard approach)
* Whether Junie should build the project before submitting the result
* Any code-style related instructions

As an option you can ask Junie to create these guidelines for you.

This is the backend of the BeerScanner application, which is a Spring Boot project. The frontend is in `frontend/` and is a typescript app. It may be read (for type referencing) if explicitly stated, but you should NEVER modify anything in `frontend/`
